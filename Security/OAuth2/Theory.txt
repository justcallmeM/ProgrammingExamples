OAuth2 Access Tokens
    Description: OAuth 2.0 is a standard for token-based authorization on the internet. OAuth2 
        access tokens are granted after user authentication and authorization.
    Types:
        Bearer Tokens: A type of OAuth2 token that is simply passed as part of the HTTP request header, very similar to JWT.
        MAC Tokens (Message Authentication Code): A more complex type of OAuth2 token that includes a 
            cryptographic MAC to ensure the token's integrity.However, MAC tokens are not widely used compared to bearer tokens.


OAuth2 Access Tokens
    Pros:
        Industry standard for authorization.
        Can use different grant types (Authorization Code, Implicit, Password, Client Credentials).
        Integrates well with third-party authentication providers.
    Cons:
        Complexity: Requires understanding and managing OAuth2 flows.
        Storage: Tokens usually have to be stored in the server for stateful validation.
