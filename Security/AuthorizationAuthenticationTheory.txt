        * Authentication and Authorization:
         
        * Authentication: 
            Definition: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It answers the question, "Who are you?"
            Purpose: To ensure that the entity attempting to access the system is who they claim to be.
            Common Methods:
                Password-based authentication: Involves verifying a user's identity using a combination of a username and password.
                Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Combines two or more authentication methods, such as something the user knows (password), has (security token), or is (fingerprint).
                Biometric authentication: Uses physical characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans.
                Token-based authentication: Users are authenticated via tokens (such as JWT) that are issued upon successful login and presented in subsequent requests.
            Examples:
                Login functionality: When a user provides their username and password, the application verifies these credentials against its records.

        * Authorization:
            Definition: Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?"
            Purpose: To ensure that authenticated users can only access resources and perform actions that they are permitted to.
            Common Methods:
                Role-based access control (RBAC): Permissions are assigned based on user roles (e.g., Admin, User, Guest).
                Attribute-based access control (ABAC): Decisions are made based on attributes (e.g., user, resource, environment).
                Access control lists (ACL): Define which users or groups have access to specific resources.
            Examples:
                Permission Checks: After a user is authenticated, the system checks their permissions to determine whether they can access a particular resource or perform a specific action.


        * Practical Usage in Applications:
            Combined Workflow: 
                a. Authentication: 
                    User logs in with credentials 
                    → Server verifies identity 
                    → Issues a JWT token. 
                b. Authorization: 
                    Token is included in each request 
                    → Server checks permissions based on token claims 
                    → Grants or denies access based on roles/permissions.
