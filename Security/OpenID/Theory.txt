OpenID is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol that allows users to be authenticated by relying on third-party services, called OpenID providers (OPs), eliminating the need for service providers (RPs) to manage and store login credentials. It enables a user to log into multiple, unrelated websites without having to create and manage multiple separate login credentials.
Key Concepts of OpenID
1. OpenID Provider (OP):
An entity that authenticates the end-user and provides information about the user to third-party services.
Examples: Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc., can act as OpenID providers.
2. Relying Party (RP):
The service (website or application) that requests authentication from an OpenID Provider to validate the user.
Examples: Websites like StackOverflow, GitHub, etc., that use third-party authentication.
3. OpenID Identifier:
A unique identifier that represents the user in the OpenID system.
It can be either a URL (e.g., https://example.com/johndoe) or an XRDS (Extensible Resource Descriptor Sequence) document.
4. Discovery:
The process by which a Relying Party determines the OpenID Provider for a given OpenID Identifier.
This typically involves looking up metadata on the user's identifier URL.
How OpenID Authentication Works
The authentication flow typically involves the following steps:
User Initiates Login:
The user visits a Relying Party (RP) and selects to log in using an OpenID Provider.
RP Redirects to OP:
The RP redirects the user to their chosen OpenID Provider. This redirection includes a request for authentication.
User Authenticates with OP:
The user logs into their account at the OpenID Provider. If the user is already logged in, this step might be skipped.
OP Redirects Back to RP:
After authentication, the OP redirects the user back to the RP with an authentication response. This includes an assertion of the user’s identity.
RP Validates Assertion:
The RP verifies the authenticity of the assertion, often by checking the signature using the OP's public key.
Access Granted or Denied:
If the assertion is valid, the RP grants access to the user. Otherwise, access is denied.
Example Use Case
Consider a scenario where an OpenID provider (like Google) is used to log into a website (like StackOverflow).
1. User Initiates Login:
The user clicks on "Login with Google" on StackOverflow.
2. RP Redirects to OP:
StackOverflow (RP) redirects the user to Google's login page with a request for authentication.

Copy http
GET https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?
    response_type=code&
    client_id=CLIENT_ID&
    redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&
    scope=openid%20email%20profile&
    state=STATE
3. User Authenticates with OP:
The user enters their Google credentials and logs in.
4. OP Redirects Back to RP:
Google authenticates the user and redirects them back to StackOverflow with an authentication response.

Copy http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://stackoverflow.com/oauth2callback?
    code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&
    state=STATE
5. RP Validates Assertion:
StackOverflow servers validate the authorization code by calling Google’s token endpoint and verify the identity token.

Copy http
POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=CLIENT_ID&
client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET&
code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&
grant_type=authorization_code&
redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI
6. Access Granted or Denied:
If the identity is validated, StackOverflow grants the user access to their account. Otherwise, access is denied.
OpenID Connect (OIDC)
OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0. While OpenID provides a way to authenticate users, OIDC adds more functionalities and uses OAuth 2.0 for the authentication process.
Key Features of OpenID Connect:
Standardized User Info Endpoint: Provides a standard way to retrieve user profile information.
Tokens: Uses ID tokens (JWT) to convey user authentication information.
Optional Functions: Allows the inclusion of additional authentication processes like multi-factor authentication.
Interoperability: Ensures better interoperability between different implementations of OpenID Connect.
Example Token Endpoint Response:

Copy json
{
  "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN",
  "id_token": "ID_TOKEN",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "scope": "openid email profile"
}
ID Token: Contains user identity claims (subject, issuer, audience, etc.), typically in JWT format.
Summary
OpenID simplifies the user experience by allowing users to authenticate with a single set of credentials across multiple services. OpenID Connect enhances OpenID by providing a seamless and secure authentication process built on top of OAuth 2.0, ensuring interoperability and secure identity verification.
By leveraging OpenID and OpenID Connect, you can streamline authentication processes, reduce the need for multiple passwords, and improve security across different platforms.
