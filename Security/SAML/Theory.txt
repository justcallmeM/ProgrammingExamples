SAML Tokens (Security Assertion Markup Language)
    Description: SAML tokens are typically used in Single Sign-On (SSO) scenarios to 
        communicate user authentication and authorization data across domains and services.
    Structure: SAML tokens are XML-based and contain assertions made about the user 
        such as identity and attributes.
