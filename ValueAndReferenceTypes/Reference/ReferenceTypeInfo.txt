Reference types are stored on the heap.

Variables of reference types store references to their data (objects)
With reference types, two variables can reference the same object;
therefore, operations on one variable can affect the object referenced by the other variable

Reference type is garbage collected.

Reference types are nullable by default.

Reference types:
    class type:
        class, object, string
    interface
    delegate
    record
    dynamic
    array type:
        value type
        class type
        interface
        delegate
        dynamic
        pointer (only available in unsafe code)
