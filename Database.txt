• Indexes: 
    An index is used to speed up searching in the database.
    Indexes are used to find rows with specific column values quickly.
    
    
    The name index was chosen because of how an index works in a book.
    For example:
        if you want to learn about matrix'es you would not flip through the
        whole math book page by page scanning for the term "matrix".
        Instead you'd go to the index find the term "matrix" and you'd see
        a list of pages.

    This technique is used by databases.
        When you create an index, the database will create a method to rapidly
        find data based on one or more columns.

    Indexes use database storage, thus creating a lot of indexes can harm the database.
